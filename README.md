## Webgrafy

<p>To do this project i was inspired by:

<img src="./img/inspo_tv.jpg">

- The Simpsons tv serie🏄‍♂️

## To improve and develop :weight_lifting:

I had some problems to add the hour/date in the channels screen.

I've difficulties of:
- Adjustment the GIF inside de screen.
- Delete the channels and information when tv is off.

Also the css stylesheet could be more extensive to design the tv better.
